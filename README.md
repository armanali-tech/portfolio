1. **Home Page**: Dynamic and visually appealing with integrated particles, it introduces me and highlights some of my projects.

2. **About Page**: Provides a brief overview of my background and lists some of my major skills.

3. **Portfolio Page**: Showcases a selection of my live projects, offering a detailed look into my coding endeavors.

4. **Contact Us Page**: Features a user-friendly contact form backed by a third-party API for direct communication.
